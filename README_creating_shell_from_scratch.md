# Summary
If we have multiple source files, in c, in c++, then during building/compiling, we have mention the name of the files and all the tags everytime.
for example, if I have 3 files "main.c, hello.c, add.c", and I want to compile it:
```
gcc add.c heelo.c main.c -o final_compiled

./final_compiled
```

Makefile is a set of commands 

# Linux shell commands

## ls (for listing)
